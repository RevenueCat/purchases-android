### Identity V3:

In this version, weâ€™ve redesigned the way that user identification works. 
Detailed docs about the new system are available [here](https://docs.revenuecat.com/v3.2/docs/user-ids).

#### New methods
- Introduces `logIn`, a new way of identifying users, which also returns whether a new user has been registered in the system. 
`logIn` uses a new backend endpoint. 
- Introduces `logOut`, a replacement for `reset`. 

#### Deprecations / removals
- deprecates `createAlias` in favor of `logIn`
- deprecates `identify` in favor of `logIn`
- deprecates `reset` in favor of `logOut`
- deprecates `allowSharingPlayStoreAccount` in favor of dashboard-side configuration
