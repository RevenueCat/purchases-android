### Amazon Store Support
Introduced support for using Amazon Store. We have extensively tested the Amazon Store, and there are some application already in production using it, but being 5.0.0 the first official release that supports it, there could still be some issues, please report any issue you find. [New RevenueCat Issue](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/issues/new/).

You can enable Amazon Store support by configuring the SDK using the new configure function:

```
Purchases.configure(AmazonConfiguration.Builder(this, "public_amazon_sdk_key").build())
```

For more information please take a look at the [Amazon Store section in our docs](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/amazon-platform-resources). 

If you're updating from an alpha version with Amazon Store support. Remove the in-app-purchasing-2.0.76.jar dependency from your `app/build.gradle` and from the libs folder. Manually adding the jar is no longer required üòÑ

```
dependencies {
    implementation files('libs/in-app-purchasing-2.0.76.jar') -> Remove this
```
