<p>An entitlement represents features or content that a user is "entitled" to.
Entitlements are unlocked by having an active subscription or making a one-time purchase.
Many different products can unlock. Most subscription apps only have one entitlement,
unlocking all premium features. However, if you had two tiers of content such as premium and
premium_plus, you would have 2 entitlements. A common and simple setup example is one entitlement
with identifier pro, one offering monthly, with one product.

<p>Most well monetized subscription apps provide many different offerings to purchase an
entitlement. These are usually associated with different durations i.e. an annual plan and a
monthly plan.

<p>Entry point for Purchases. It should be instantiated as soon as your app has a unique user id
for your user. This can be when a user logs in if you have accounts or on launch if you can
generate a random user identifier.
Make sure you follow the <a href="https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started-1">quickstart</a>
guide to setup your RevenueCat account.</p>
