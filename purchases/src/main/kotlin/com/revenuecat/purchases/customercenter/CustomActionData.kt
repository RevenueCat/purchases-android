/**
 * Data associated with a custom action selection in the Customer Center.
 *
 * This class encapsulates information about a custom action that has been triggered
 * in the Customer Center. Custom actions are defined in the configuration and allow
 * applications to handle specialized user flows beyond well-known actions.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Custom actions are handled through the CustomerCenterListener:
 *
 * val listener = object : CustomerCenterListener {
 *     override fun onCustomActionSelected(actionIdentifier: String, purchaseIdentifier: String?) {
 *         // Handle the custom action
 *         when (actionIdentifier) {
 *             "delete_user" -> deleteUserAccount()
 *             "rate_app" -> showAppStoreRating()
 *             else -> {
 *                 // Handle unknown action
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
