Automatic Releasing using CircleCI
=========
For an almost fully automated release process, use the trigger pipeline feature in CircleCI passing name `action` and value `bump`

You can achieve the same using CircleCI API:

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/github/RevenueCat/purchases-android/pipeline' \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            -u "your_circleci_personal_token:" \
            -d '{
              "branch": "main",
              "parameters": {
                "action": "bump"
              }
            }'
```

Automatic Releasing using your machine
=========
1. Create a `fastlane/.env` file with your GitHub API token (see `fastlane/.env.SAMPLE`). This will be used to create the PR, so you should use your own token so the PR gets assigned to you.
2. Run `bundle exec fastlane android bump`
 1. Confirm base branch is correct
 2. Input new version number
 3. Update CHANGELOG.latest.md to include the latest changes. Call out API changes (if any). You can use the existing CHANGELOG.md as a base for formatting. To compile the changelog, you can compare the changes between the base branch for the release (usually main) against the latest release, by checking https://github.com/revenuecat/purchases-android/compare/<latest_release>...<base_branch>. For example, https://github.com/revenuecat/purchases-android/compare/5.1.1...main.
 4. A new branch and PR will automatically be created
3. Wait until PR is approved (don't merge yet) and pull branch from origin (to make sure you've got all the changes locally)
4. When the PR is approved, approve the hold job created in CircleCI. CircleCI will create a tag for the version. Alternatively, you can tag the last commit in the release branch and push it to the repository.
5. The rest will be performed automatically by CircleCI. If the automation fails, you can revert to manually calling `bundle exec fastlane android deploy`.
6. After that, you can merge the release PR to main and merge the bump to the next snapshot version PR right after.

Hotfix Releases
=========
Sometimes you might need to release a patch on a version that's not the latest. Or sometimes there might have been commits on main that shouldn't be released, but the latest version has a big bug. For example, let's say the last version is 4.0.0, but there's a bug on 3.9.0 that needs to be released as a 3.9.1:

1. Open a PR with the fix, merge it to main.
1. Jump to 3.9.0 and create a new branch release/3.9.0. Push this branch since it will be used as base for the PR you will open in the next steps.
1. Run `bundle exec fastlane android bump` as you would do with any release. This will create a new PR `release/3.9.1`. Make sure the base branch of the PR is pointing to `release/3.9.0` and that the PR is labeled with **DO NOT MERGE** (add it to the title too so it's not merged by mistake)
1. Locally, while in branch the release branch (`release/3.9.1` in this case), cherry pick the changes with your fix that you just merged to `main` using `git cherry-pick <sha_of_the_squashed_commit_in_main>`. Fix any conflicts if there are any. Push the cherry picked commit to the remote branch `release/3.9.1`.
1. When the PR is approved, **DO NOT MERGE IT**. Approve the hold job in CircleCI as you would do for any other release. If there is no hold job because the release is older than when we introduced that job, manually tag the last commit in `release/3.9.1` with `3.9.1`.
1. CircleCI will start the deployment process
1. Close the PR after the release has been completed and delete both `release/3.9.0` and `release/3.9.1` branches.
1. Remember to edit the CHANGELOG.md in `main` to include the version that has been just released

Fixing timeouts when closing repository
=========
Sonatype might fail when performing the `closeAndRelease` step. Fortunately, we can close and release manually if the publish task succeeds.
- Head to https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories, login using the credentials in 1Password
- That link should redirect you to the Staging Repositories section, if it doesn't go to that section on the left hand side of the website, under the Build Promotion section.
- You should see one staging repository there. If there are more than one, drop all of them and rerun the failing job in CircleCI.
- Select the only repository available, then do Close. When close finishes, do Release and automatically drop the repository.
