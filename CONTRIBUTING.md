## Contributing

### You can do this!
We've tagged a number of issues as [you can do this!](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/labels/you%20can%20do%20this%21). These will generally not require much (or any!) working knowledge of our SDK.

If you decide you want to help, that [you can do this!](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/labels/you%20can%20do%20this%21) tag is a good place to start. Now, here's how you can actually get going:

- Follow the directions from [2. Create a fork/branch.](#2-create-a-forkbranch) to setup your environment.
- Find an issue that speaks to you, and comment in it "I've got this" or something like that üòÑ.
- If the issue isn't clear enough, feel free to tag in sdk team `@RevenueCat/sdk` asking for clarification.
- Work on the issue! 
- If that builds, then follow [the final steps (Create a pull request to RevenueCat)](#5-create-a-pull-request-to-revenuecatmain-and-request-review)
- Done!

## Environment Setup

We use sdkman to specify the environment that should be used when developing. Install sdkman using  their 
[official instructions](https://sdkman.io/install). Navigate to the root of this project and do `sdk env install`,
which should install the specific Java version we expect you to use.

```bash
bundle exec fastlane setup_dev
```

It links in our pre-commit hook to run detekt. That saves you time so you don't have to wait for our CI to do it ‚è±.

#### 1. Create an issue to make sure its something that should be done.

Before submitting a Github issue, please make sure to

- Search for [existing Github issues](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/issues)

- Read our [docs.revenuecat.com](https://docs.revenuecat.com/)

## Common project specific issues

There are certain project specific issues that are commonly misinterpreted as bugs.

- [Offerings, products, or available packages are empty](https://support.revenuecat.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041793174)
- [Invalid Play Store credentials errors](https://support.revenuecat.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046398913)
- [Unable to connect to the App Store (STORE_PROBLEM) errors](https://support.revenuecat.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046399333)

For support I'd recommend our [online community](https://community.revenuecat.com), 
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/revenuecat/) and/or 
[Help Center](https://support.revenuecat.com/hc/en-us) üëç

If you have a clearly defined bug (with a 
[Minimal, Complete, and Reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)) that is not 
specific to your project, follow the steps in the GitHub Issue template to file it with RevenueCat without removing any 
of the steps. For SDK-related bugs, make sure they can be reproduced on a physical device, 
not a simulator (there are simulator-specific problems that prevent purchases from working).

#### 2. Create a fork/branch.

#### 3. Do your work.

Be sure to adhere to the prevailing style of the project.

#### 4. Write tests for your fix/new functionality.

You can use the `purchase-tester` project in the `examples` folder as a tester app for manual tests. Specify your 
RevenueCat API key in the `MainApplication` class. You can also change the package name in the `build.gradle` file
to your own so you can test with real products.  

#### 5. Create a pull request to revenuecat/main and request review

Explain in your pull request the work that was done, the reasoning, and that tests passed.

#### 6. Make changes in response to review

#### 7. Bask in the glory of community maintained software
