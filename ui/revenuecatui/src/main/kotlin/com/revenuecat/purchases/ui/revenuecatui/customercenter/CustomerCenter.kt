/**
* Use the Customer Center in your app to help your customers manage common support tasks.
*
* Customer Center is a self-service UI that can be added to your app to help
* your customers manage their subscriptions on their own. With it, you can prevent
* churn with pre-emptive promotional offers, capture actionable customer data with
* exit feedback prompts, and lower support volumes for common inquiries â€” all
* without any help from your support team.
*
* The `CustomerCenter` composable is a full screen UI that can be used to integrate
* the Customer Center directly in your app with Compose.
*
* For more information, see the [Customer Center docs](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/customer-center).
