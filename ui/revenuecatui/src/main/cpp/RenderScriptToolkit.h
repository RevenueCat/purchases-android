/**
 * A collection of high-performance graphic utility functions like blur and blend.
 *
 * This toolkit provides ten image manipulation functions: blend, blur, color matrix, convolve,
 * histogram, histogramDot, lut, lut3d, resize, and YUV to RGB. These functions execute
 * multithreaded on the CPU.
 *
 * These functions work over raw byte arrays. You'll need to specify the width and height of
 * the data to be processed, as well as the number of bytes per pixel. For most use cases,
 * this will be 4.
 *
 * You should instantiate the Toolkit once and reuse it throughout your application.
 * On instantiation, the Toolkit creates a thread pool that's used for processing all the functions.
 * You can limit the number of pool threads used by the Toolkit via the constructor. The pool
 * threads are destroyed once the Toolkit is destroyed, after any pending work is done.
 *
 * This library is thread safe. You can call methods from different pool threads. The functions will
 * execute sequentially.
 *
 * A Java/Kotlin Toolkit is available. It calls this library through JNI.
 *
 * This toolkit can be used as a replacement for most RenderScript Intrinsic functions. Compared
 * to RenderScript, it's simpler to use and more than twice as fast on the CPU. However RenderScript
 * Intrinsics allow more flexibility for the type of allocation supported. In particular, this
 * toolkit does not support allocations of floats.

     * accepts values between 1 and 25. Larger values create a more blurred effect but also
     * take longer to compute. When the radius extends past the edge, the edge pixel will
     * be used as replacement for the pixel that's out off boundary.

     * for the less common blurring of alpha channel only image.

     * of each buffer. If provided, the range must be wholly contained with the dimensions
     * described by sizeX and sizeY.

     * The input and output buffers must have the same dimensions. Both buffers should be
     * large enough for sizeX * sizeY * vectorSize bytes. The buffers have a row-major layout.

     * @param sizeY The height of both buffers, as a number of 1 or 4 byte cells.
     * @param vectorSize Either 1 or 4, the number of bytes in each cell, i.e. A vs. RGBA.
     * @param radius The radius of the pixels used to blur.
     * @param restriction When not null, restricts the operation to a 2D range of pixels.
